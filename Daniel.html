                        <h1>My Qualifications to recommend this man for this postion are listed below</h1>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/danielpiccompressed.jpg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <ol>
                            <li>I am a Nation of</li>
                            <li>I have been a son for all 24 years</li>
                            <li>I am an avid dirt biking student, taught by truly only the best</li>
                            <li>I have a legacy game competency certificate in Gloomhaven, FrostHaven, Seafall, Pandemic Legacy, and Betrayl at House on the Hill Legacy</li>
                            <li>I am a Twilight Imperium faction commander with experience commanding armies such as the Xxcha, the Yin Brotherhoo, the Clan of Saar, the Nomad, and the Universites of JolNar</li>
                            <li>I was granted the wizard's honorary medal for best Dungeons and Dragons world builder on my first attempt, and also managed to occupy several elementary to teenage age people's attention with it for multiple hours at a time on a vacation to Hawaii. HAWAII.</li>
                            <li>I have introductory experience with Injection Molding and Project Management</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">DAD: My Recomendation</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First, this man is truly one of the few "true men out in the world today. You can tell mainly because there is practically no object in his own home that he will not promptly dispose of if it poses and obstacle to his path. Men arrive at peak glory when they have such a flow of assets that, rather than owning things, they purchase and destroy objects at their leisure and to fir their needs"</li>
                            <li>Another way you can tell is that he is a carnivore. Truly only men worth knowing and hiring are men who consume large amoints of red meat. This is especially true because he marinates and grill/smokes it himself.</li>
                            <li>The third way you know that he is distinctly qualified is that he is absolutely willing to seize anything interesting and give it an honest try: Climbing? Did it. Biking? Did it. Snowmobiling? Did it. Entrepreneurship? Childs' play. Raising SIX KIDS? IN HIS SLEEP HE DID IT!</li>
                            <li>Finally, and the most qualifying attribue he has, he is capable of falling asleep on the couch in the middle of an action movie or family gathering. All other recommendations pale in comparison to this one quality</li>
                        </ul>
                        <!-- <h2 class="section-heading">Reaching for the Stars</h2>
                        <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>

                        <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
                        <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
