                        <p>Hi! I'm Julia! I am the only daughter of David. As such, I am qualified to recommend him to you. As you can see below, I am a certified BYU fan, and as such my testament of David's character is obvously valid.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Numerous Qualifications</h2>
                        <ol>
                            <li>My name is also a programming language.</li>
                            <li>I’m the only daughter of David for a solid 18 ⅔ years.</li>
                            <li>I’m a certified basement-dweller annoyer, using the method of Irish dance.</li>
                            <li>I have a journaling streak of 8 months.</li>
                            <li>I have watched most of the Marvel movies.</li>
                            <li>I can prove things that most people don’t even think about.</li>
                            <li>I go to the same eye doctor as the man himself.</li>
                            <li>I can recite the entire story of the little red hen by memory (thanks to my dad), and as a result have not one, but two time lapses of myself kneading and forming 20 loaves of bread.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">My Recommendations</h2>
                        <p>He is willing to use whatever talents he has! I recall a memory from his days on the High Council of the American Fork West stake when he came back from a meeting quite alarmed, because he had been asked to play the piano. He got up and played one of the few songs he still remembers! This man will use whatever skills he has at his disposal to get to his goal! He is aware of the impact he has personally!</p>
                        <p>He likes to move and groove! You need him as a member of your staff, because he will convince everyone to get out and do something! I recall the days that we spent in Maui, hawaii, when he got us up at 8 am every day to go out and surf. They were good, long days. He likes to go out and do things, for sure!</p>
                        <p>He is the master of cleaning rhetoric. Keep your ears open, because before having him long you might start to hear phrases like “just pick up 10 things off the floor and then come talk to me”, or “spend 10 minutes cleaning, that’s all”, and before you know it your workspace will be cleaner than you had ever thought fathomable! It’s a dangerous game!</p>
                        <p>Projects are his specialty! From mastering the art of snowmobiling, rock climbing, dirt biking, grilling, and so many more hobbies, you never know what’s coming next! He will take your projects and hack at them intensely until everything is complete! You see, this man knows how to work!</p>
                        <p>He prioritizes his family relationships. Now, I know that as an employer you might shrink back from this quality, but I promise you this is good! Sometimes he comes home and tells the whole family the problem he is riddling out at work that day (don’t worry, he protects the innocent though). He tells us all of his stories, and then listens to us tell ours! He also values other relationships, and is very kind to those he meets! Once he was at a lunch meeting with a possible customer and ended up giving the guy the heimlich! It didn’t matter that he wasn’t a customer yet! My dad cares about people!</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">In Summary:</h2>
                        <p>My dad is a stud. The end.</p>
